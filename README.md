## Example JSON Schema

You can use the following example schema to generate dynamic forms:

```json
{
  "formTitle": "Project Requirements Survey",
  "formDescription": "Please fill out this survey about your project needs",
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "name",
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Full Name",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter your full name"
    },
    {
      "id": "email",
      "type": "email",
      "label": "Email Address",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "you@example.com",
      "validation": {
        "pattern": "^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$",
        "message": "Please enter a valid email address"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "comments",

      "label": "Additional Comments",
      "required": false,
      "placeholder": "Any other details you'd like to share..."
